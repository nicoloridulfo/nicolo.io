It all began with simple websites and text adventure games. I liked the challenge of using pieces of knowledge to build more complex things. Today, the only thing that has changed is the amount of experience I have. I've programmed in over a dozen languages in countless projects. On a professional level, I have written software that powers a bank's day to day operation which has a yearly turnover in the billions of SEK. <br><br> From my studies and hobby projects, I gained experience with machine learning. Both on an academical level, understanding the mathematics behind the models and on a practical level, applying the models to real world problems. <br><br> I have worked in cross-functional teams and I am therefore well accustomed to working with people of different experities. I also have experience in working with a variety of project models such as scrum, kanban and waterfall. </p> <br> <hr> <br> You may change the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">Cellular Automata</a> rule: <div id="ruleButtonContainer"></div> </div> </div> </body></html>
